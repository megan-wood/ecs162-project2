                Wordle is a game where you guess what the mystery word is. To play, you will use your keyboard
                to type what you think is the mystery word. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Backspace: you can delete the current letter with backspace. You can continue to delete until the very first letter, 
                which will automatically change based on what key you press.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enter: press 'enter' to submit and check your solution
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you hit 'enter', the current row will show you if you got <span style="color: green">both the letter and position 
                correct (the tile will turn green) </span>, if you got <span style="color: rgb(187, 178, 15)"> a correct letter but wrong position 
                (the tile will turn yellow)</span>, or if the <span style="color: grey">letter  does not exist in the word (the tile will 
                turn grey).</span>
               
            </p>
            <p>
                To replay the game or restart, the 'New Game' button at the bottom of the page. To make sure the letters are recorded,
                please click somewhere on the grid to begin again.
            </p>
            <p>
                (also the keyboard at the bottom is just a reference to see what letters there are on the keyboard. they will have no color
                changes and any action when clicked on)
            </p>
