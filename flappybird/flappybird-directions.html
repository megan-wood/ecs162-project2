                    To play Flappy Bird, press the arrow key up to make the bird fly and avoid
                    the pipes and not hit the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game ends when you hit one of the pipes either on the top or the bottom, 
                    or if you hit the ground.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    This game has been adapted from code by Patrick (Github username: patlov) with 
                    an MIT license.
                    We changed the icon of the bird to match our theme and changed the styling of
                    the page to go along with our theme as well. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also added a function to handle the keypresses. Originally, the developer, 
                    handeled the keypresses not in a function, so we moved it into a function. 
                    Originally, you pressed the space bar to move the bird, but this was forcing the 
                    page to scroll down as well when the key was pressed. Therfore, we changed it to 
                    be the arrow up key to move the bird up, and also prevented the page from scrolling
                    when pressing the arrow up or down key.
